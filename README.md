# weatherApp

Exercise using Jquery get requests. An example API was set up which contained cites, with various weather related data.
The user can select a city and the page will update with that cities weather information.

# Pair Partner

For this task I pair programmed with [Julian Veling](https://github.com/veliancreate). 
We were able to complete the specification and also add in dynamically updating backgrounds, which are relevant to the weather type.
